## What is Hazel for Mac?

Hazel for Mac is an intelligent automation tool designed to keep your files organized effortlessly. It monitors designated folders and automatically sorts, tags, renames, or deletes files based on custom rules you create. Whether it's cleaning up your Downloads folder, archiving old documents, or sorting photos by date, Hazel works silently in the background to maintain order.

The software integrates deeply with macOS, supporting tags, metadata, and even AppleScript for advanced workflows. It’s perfect for both casual users and professionals who deal with large volumes of files regularly.

Hazel is compatible with all modern Macs, including those with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3), and runs smoothly on macOS Ventura and Sonoma. Its user-friendly interface makes setting up rules simple, while powerful conditions and actions offer flexibility for complex automation needs.
